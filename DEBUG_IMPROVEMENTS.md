# Domain Tracker Debug Improvements & WHOIS Analysis

## Issue Summary

The domain tracker was reporting `spectre.cx` as available when it actually has problematic statuses (`serverHold`, `pendingDelete`) according to WHOIS records. This was causing false positives and potentially wasted time/money on domains that aren't truly available.

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Debug Functionality

Added `--debug` flag to both CLI commands:

```bash
# Debug single domain check
vibe check spectre.cx --debug

# Debug batch domain checking  
vibe check-domains --debug
```

**Debug Output Includes:**
- Full raw API response from WhoisXML API
- Request URL with parameters (API key redacted in logs)
- HTTP status codes
- Detailed status parsing logic trace
- Network error details

### 2. Comprehensive Status Detection

**Enhanced Problematic Status Detection:**
- **Exact matches**: 25+ known problematic EPP status codes
- **Partial matching**: Keyword-based detection for complex status strings
- **URL parsing**: Handles statuses like `"clientDeleteProhibited (https://www.icann.org/epp#clientDeleteProhibited)"`
- **Case insensitive**: Works with mixed-case status responses

**New Problematic Statuses Added:**
```python
# Delete/Expiration related
"pendingdelete", "redemptionperiod", "renewperiod"

# Hold statuses
"clienthold", "serverhold"

# Transfer restrictions
"transferperiod", "pendingtransfer", "clienttransferprohibited", "servertransferprohibited"

# Update/Delete restrictions  
"clientdeleteprohibited", "serverdeleteprohibited", "clientupdateprohibited", "serverupdateprohibited"

# Registration/verification issues
"registrantverificationpending", "pendingverification", "pendingnotification", "addperiod", "autorenewperiod"

# Additional problematic states
"pendingcreate", "pendingupdate", "pendingrenew", "pendingrelease", "pendingrebill", "pendingrestore"
```

**Keyword-based Detection:**
- `"pending"` + `"delete"` → `pendingDelete`
- `"hold"` → `clientHold` or `serverHold` 
- `"redemption"` → `redemptionPeriod`
- `"prohibited"` → various prohibited statuses

### 3. Logic Improvements

**Before:**
- Simple exact string matching
- Limited status coverage
- No debug visibility into API responses

**After:**
- Multi-layered status detection (exact + partial + keyword)
- Comprehensive EPP status code coverage
- Full API response transparency with debug mode
- Better normalization handling complex status formats

## API Analysis & Limitations

### Current WhoisXML Domain Availability API

**What we discovered:**
1. **Limited Status Information**: The Domain Availability API may not expose all detailed WHOIS status fields
2. **Simple Response Format**: Often returns just `"domainAvailability": "AVAILABLE/UNAVAILABLE"` without detailed status arrays
3. **Missing EPP Status Codes**: Critical statuses like `serverHold`, `pendingDelete` may not be included in this API endpoint

**Example Response for spectre.cx (expected):**
```json
{
  "DomainInfo": {
    "domainAvailability": "AVAILABLE",  // ← This could be misleading
    "domainName": "spectre.cx"
    // Missing: "status": ["serverHold", "pendingDelete"]
  }
}
```

### Alternative WHOIS API Recommendations

If the current provider continues to provide insufficient detail, consider these alternatives:

#### 1. WhoisXML Full WHOIS API (Upgrade)
```
Endpoint: https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/whoisserver/WhoisService
Benefits: 
- Complete EPP status codes
- Full registrar information  
- Detailed expiration/creation dates
- More accurate status detection
Cost: Higher per query, but more accurate
```

#### 2. WHOISJSON API 
```
Endpoint: https://whoisjson.com/api/v1/whois
Benefits:
- Comprehensive WHOIS data
- Real-time status information
- Detailed status arrays
- Good documentation
```

#### 3. Domain Research Suite (WhoAPI)
```
Endpoint: https://whoapi.com/
Benefits:
- Multiple data sources
- Comprehensive domain status
- Good reliability
- Competitive pricing
```

#### 4. RDAP (Registration Data Access Protocol)
```
Benefits:
- Standardized protocol
- Direct from registries
- Most accurate status information
- Often free
Drawbacks:
- More complex to implement
- Varies by TLD
- Rate limiting
```

## Testing the Debug Functionality

### Test Cases for spectre.cx-like Issues

```bash
# Test with known problematic domain
echo "spectre.cx" > domains.txt
vibe check-domains --debug

# Test single domain
vibe check spectre.cx --debug

# Test with multiple potentially problematic domains
echo -e "spectre.cx\nother-pending-domain.com\navailable-domain.com" > domains.txt
vibe check-domains --debug
```

### Expected Debug Output

With debug mode, you should see:
1. **Full API URL** with all parameters
2. **Complete JSON response** from the API
3. **Status parsing trace** showing what statuses were found
4. **Logic decisions** about why a domain is marked available/unavailable

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Enable debug mode** for spectre.cx specifically to see what the API is actually returning
2. **Document the raw response** to understand if the issue is with the API or our parsing
3. **Test with other known problematic domains** to validate the enhanced logic

### If Current API is Insufficient
1. **Upgrade to WhoisXML Full WHOIS API** for more detailed status information
2. **Implement fallback logic** to cross-check with multiple providers for critical domains
3. **Add domain status caching** to avoid repeated false positives

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Multi-provider validation** for high-value domains
2. **Manual override system** for known problematic domains
3. **Historical tracking** of domain status changes to identify patterns

## Usage Instructions

```bash
# Check a single potentially problematic domain with full debug info
vibe check spectre.cx --debug

# Run batch checks with debug output  
vibe check-domains --debug

# Test enhanced status detection
echo "test-domain-with-complex-status.com" > domains.txt
vibe check-domains --debug
```

The debug output will help identify exactly what status information is available from the API and whether we need to switch to a more comprehensive WHOIS provider.
